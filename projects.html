         <h4>Influence of channel configuration on bandwidth of cadmium zinc telluride detector with a cross-strip pattern</h4>
         <p> The goal of this project is to improve the bandwidth of a cross-strip CZT detector, which has 39 anodes and 8 cathodes and needs two RENA-3 ASIC to readout its signal. I simulated the detector response in GATE and wrote a program to mimic the ASIC performance, taking Compton scattering and charge sharing into consideration. My work showed that half-half anode pattern had a larger bandwidth than alternate anode pattern and cathode pattern could be further optimized based on the load.

         <h4>Separation of scintillation and Cherenkov lights in linear alkyl benzene</h4>
        <p> Water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) is a promising detecting material for next generation of neutrino and proton decay experiments. This purpose of this project is to verify the separable measurement of the simultaneous scintillation and Cherenkov lights in linear alkyl benzene (LAB), which is an important component of WbLS. I participated in the mechanical design of a 20-L capacity detector. Then I picked out six Philips PMTs with little noise and small after-pulses for the trigger system and calibrated the gain of two  PMTs for measuring scintillation and Cherenkov lights in LAB. The trigger signals and LAB lights were recorded by a FADC CAEN VX1721, and data was acquired by a DAQ program based on <a href="https://midas.triumf.ca/MidasWiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank"> MIDAS</a>. I designed a waveform-screening algorithm for data selection. The average time spectra of scintillation and Cherenkov lights were fitted by a biexponential function convoluted with a Gaussian detector response to get the rising and decay constants and light yield of scintillation light of LAB. The result is essential for guiding the making of WbLS. [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900216305411" target="_blank">paper</a>]</p>

         <h4>Assay of low-background stainless steel by smelting for the neutrino experiment at Jinping</h4>
        <p> The goal of this project is to smelt low-radioactivity stainless steel (SST) that is compatible with the ultra-low background requirement in Jinping Neutrino Experiment. I used a high-purity germanium detector to measure the radioactivity of raw materials and commercial samples of SST and wrote a program that could automatically identify radionuclide type and compute its radioactivity. My work helped to identify contamination sources such as C and Si and promoted to contributed to the smelting of custom-made SST samples whose radioactivity was comparable to those used in other neutrino expeirments such as Borexino and NEXT.

         <h4>Adding particle hit errors to EUDET-type beam telescopes</h4>
        <p> The goal of the project is to find accurate particle hit errors and implement it into the corresponding data analysis framework EUTelescope. I put forward a model to describe the decisive role of pixel activation thresholds on particle hit errors, and verified my model by moving particles from a specific activated pattern into one pixel so that the distributions of hit positions could be shown directly. My work improved particles hit errors in low and middle thresholds, which was important for finding more real particle tracks and improving track errors. </p>
